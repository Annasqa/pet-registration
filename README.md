### Pet Registration Application

### April 2, 2015

An application which registered a pet into the pet registering system. The application should ask how many pets they would like to register. For each pet, they should be asked what type of pet they will be registering (dog, cat, fish, bird, reptile, or horse). If the type is not a valid registrable pet, the system should let the user know but if it is an acceptable pet than the price should be confirmed with the user. For confirming the price to register the pet for 1 year, you should use a switch statement to determine the price. If the user decides to follow through with the registration process, they should than enter the pets Name (String), Address(String), Age (int), Whether they have a Rabies shot (boolean), Yearly Pet Fees (double), and Gender (char) - you should use your helper methods to save time coding this. The number of pets that will be entered into the array, should be determined at the start of the application. Upon exiting, all the registered pet details should be echoed to the user. Good Luck!
